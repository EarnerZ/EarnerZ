- 👋 Hi, I’m @EarnerZ from Spain
- 👀 I’m interested in Python for machine learning applications
- 🌱 I’m currently a rookie of Python, TensorFlow2, Deep Q-Learning... but my core was always (25 years) hardware engineering, electrónic & telecom systems. I learned Pascal (on 1993), some Java (on 2010) on my masterstudies, and Python + TensorFlow (on 2023)
- 💞️ I can offer to collaborate on basics programming tools, but senior-advanced on CSP and ethic deep solutions.
