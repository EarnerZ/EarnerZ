- 👋 Hi, I’m @EarnerZ from Spain
- 👀 I’m interested in Python for machine learning applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, TensorFlow2, ... but my core was always (25 years) hardware engineering, electrónic & telecom systems. I learned Pascal and some Java on my masterstudies(on 1993)
- 💞️ I can offer to collaborate on basics tools, I´ve not enought knowledge in programming Py
